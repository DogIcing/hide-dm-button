### Overview

This already feature exists on the top right corner of the page (see image below) and its styling has been annoying me for a while now.
This extension simply apply a 3 line css rule to *hide* (not remove) the button's container.
```css
[class*="createDMButtonContainer"] {
    display: none !important;
}
```
